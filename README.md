# Montana Climate Normals

This repository contains the code used to visualize Montana's climate normals for the 1991 - 2020 record on the Montana Climate Atlas. The atlas allows users to visualize average conditions of various climatological variables across Montana. An example screenshot showing mean July precipitation is attached below, and the full interactive application is available at [https://mt-climate-office.github.io/mt-normals/](https://mt-climate-office.github.io/mt-normals/).
